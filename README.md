# CV Personal Statements Game

## Business Problem

Many trainees write impersonal CV Personal Statements. We want a fun way to test how personal their statements are during class.

This project provides a website where:

- A volunteer can start a game.
- Trainees can join a started game.
- Each trainee enters their name and personal statement from their CV.
- The game shows one statement at a time (without the name) along with a list of trainees.
- Trainees guess whose statement it is.
- After everyone votes, the next statement is shown.
- At the end, the game shows how personal each statement was based on correct guesses.

## Requirements

- Simple frontend and a backend to coordinate state across users.
- No long-term persistence. All game data should be deleted after the game ends or after 24 hours.
- Access control: probably a password for joining a game, set by the volunteer.
- Must be functional, accessible, tested, and easy for CodeYourFuture volunteers to deploy and maintain.

## Features

- Real-time multiplayer game for a classroom setting.
- Trainees can enter and guess personal statements.
- Volunteer can control and start the game.
- Scoring system shows which statements were personal vs. generic.

## My Contribution

This project was developed collaboratively by a team of three, with all members contributing across the full stack, including frontend, backend, API layer, and database.

My primary contribution was implementing the core game logic, including the game engine and overall game flow. I also designed and developed the real-time multiplayer functionality, ensuring proper synchronization and consistent game state across all players.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: HTML, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Python,FastAPI
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Dev environment: Vite
